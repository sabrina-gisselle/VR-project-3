The users can go into four rooms that replicate the work of James Terrell and his work with light. Unlike the typical rules of the museum this environment allows you to alter the art either by color change or change in position. \r\n\r\nInsight goals: Users will appreciate light in a new way which is the main goal of James Terrell. Users will experience James Terrell's art work and appreciate how light can be deceiving. \r\n\r\n## Components To Help With Simulation Sickness\r\n\r\n* Didn't use HUD \r\n* Removed head bobbing functionality\r\n* Added different texture to the floor vs walls so the user knows their orientation\r\n* Added signs for each room to again orient the user and give them more information. \r\n* Minimal Lag -- Because we are dealing with light we knew that flicker would be harmful so the scene has fewer assets but greater detail on the light components.\r\n\r\n## Rooms\r\nAten Reign \r\n!(http://hyperallergic.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Turrell-AtenReign2.jpg)\r\n\r\n### Cube\r\n!(http://collections.lacma.org/sites/default/files/remote_images/piction/ma-31339450-WEB.jpg)\r\n\r\n### Window\r\n()\r\n\r\n### Skyspace\r\n!(http://turrell.utexas.edu/sites/default/files/carousel_images/014_final_edited_web.jpg)\r\n\r\n## Assests\r\n* Museum - Credit to Stephan Hernandez (in person)\r\n* Song",
