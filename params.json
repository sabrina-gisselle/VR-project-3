  "body": "## Project 3 - James Turrell Art Exhibition\r\n***\r\n\r\nThe motivation behind our project mainly stems from the influences of the Guggenheim Museum, which is located in New York.  We decided to show the user our interpretations of art originally done by James Turrell.  Turrell is an artist born in the United States who is known for his work with light and space.  By viewing light from different angles, one can create different images in oneâ€™s brain.  A classic example is using a square light to represent a box, which we do in one of our four museum rooms.  \r\n\r\n\r\nWe added user interaction in each of the rooms.  In one room, one can control the color of the lights by pressing any one of three buttons to change the intensity of either the red, the green, or the blue component of the light.  In a second room, a bright rectangular white light is projected on the wall such that it appears to be a window.  This window can be moved around in one dimension such that one can see what the light looks like in its simplest form.  In a third room, a light is displayed as a square/rectangle to create the illusion of a box extruding from the corner.  Again, the user has the ability to interact with the light by moving it around, and as such, the user can also view the light in its simplest form.  In a fourth and final room, the user can see a patch of light shining in through an opening in the roof.  A bright solar flare is seen if the user stands in the light and looks up through the gap in the roof at the sky.  The user can interact with this light by moving the spot on the floor and, subsequently, the sun in sky.\r\nThe overall goal is for users to appreciate light in a new way without actually having to go to a museum, which is also the main goal of James Turrell.  The user will experience James Turrell's art work and appreciate how truly deceiving light can be.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Components To Help With Simulation Sickness\r\n\r\n* Didn't use HUD \r\n* Removed head bobbing functionality\r\n* Added different texture to the floor vs walls so the user knows their orientation\r\n* Added signs for each room to again orient the user and give them more information. \r\n* Minimal Lag -- Because we are dealing with light we knew that flicker would be harmful so the scene has fewer assets but greater detail on the light components.\r\n\r\n[Youtube Link](https://youtu.be/grzylbyxcfU)\r\n[Zip file]()\r\n\r\n## Assests\r\n* Museum - Credit to Stephan Hernandez (in person)\r\n* [Air - Land Me (Music for Museum)](https://youtu.be/acNX_al11LY)\r\n",
